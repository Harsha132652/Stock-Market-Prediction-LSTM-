📈 Stock Market Prediction App

🚀 Project Overview

This project aims to develop a Stock Market Prediction App using Machine Learning and Deep Learning (LSTM) to forecast stock prices based on historical market data. The app will be built using the Kivy library to provide a user-friendly interface for viewing stock trends and predictions.

📌 Features (Planned)

->Fetch real-time stock market data from Alpha Vantage API

->Perform data preprocessing and feature scaling

->Implement LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model for stock price prediction

->Display interactive stock charts for actual vs. predicted prices

->Develop an intuitive mobile-friendly UI using Kivy

->Provide a seamless user experience for stock analysis

🛠️ Tech Stack

->Programming Language: Python

->Machine Learning: TensorFlow, Keras, scikit-learn

->Data Handling: Pandas, NumPy

->Data Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn

->API & Web Requests: Requests (Alpha Vantage API)

->User Interface: Kivy (for app development)

->Backend Framework: To be decided (if needed)

📜 Project Status

->✅ Data collection and preprocessing

->✅ LSTM model implementation and training

->🔄 UI development with Kivy (in progress)

->⏳ Performance evaluation and improvement (upcoming)

->⏳ Final app deployment (future milestone)



🖥️ How to Run (To Be Updated)

Instructions for running the app will be added once the Kivy-based UI is integrated.
